Various tasks were assigned as part of the internship at spark foundation.


TASK-1: Prediction using Supervised ML
Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables. Dataset used can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

TASK -2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.In the iris dataset the lengths of petals and sepals of differnet flowers were given. Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

TASK-6: Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly. Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
